# RoadRun
Game made for a Game Jam

This game was made for the Endless Jam 2022 with SDL2 by the BurnOUT team.
Every source code is free to use!

# How To Run

[There are no Windows builds yet!]

[Linux]

Download it
Go to the RoadRun directory
Run the command in terminal: "./build/linux-build.desktop"

[WEB]

Go to the webpage "https://devvs.itch.io/roadrun"
Click on the "Play" button, but please don't click out of the canvas, because it can't grab your keyboard focus again [BUG]
Currently It only worked on Firefox, for some reason, but I try to make it work on Chrome too!

# How To Rebuild

Install the compilers using this command: "./install-compilers"

Build the game to LINUX with this command: "./build-linux"
or
Build the game to WEB with this command: "./build-web"

NOTE: Building to Windows doesn't work yet
